    <h2>Action Hooks For Developers</h2>
    <p>Action hooks are like special spots in our software's code where developers can add their own custom code. These spots are already set up for developers to tap into and make changes. By doing this, developers can add new features or change how things work in our software. It's a way to make our software more flexible and adaptable to different needs.</p>

    <h2>Customizing Data in Simple Words</h2>
    <p>Developers can use their own special functions at specific places called filter points to control how data behaves or what it shows as output. This feature lets you have precise control over how data moves, so you can adjust them perfectly with what you need.</p>
